CIS1054-CourseWork-Part2

A private GitHub repository is required for Part 2 (named “cis1054-part2”). Please also include chrisporter-um along with your team members as collaborators. It doesn’t matter who creates the repository, as long as all team members are added as Collaborators.
Based on the principles and best practices discussed throughout this course, you are asked to build a dynamic website for a restaurant of choice. This website should provide:

a) generic information about the restaurant (including address and opening hours),

b) information about the people running it,

c) a way to allow users to contact the restaurant (to book a table, send a query or file a complaint),

d) information about the current menu being served at the restaurant (i.e. list of dishes) and

e) a detailed description of each item on the menu (on a separate page from the list provided in d).

f) users should be able to add individual dishes to a “favourites” list (from within the dish details page),

g) which list can then be accessed from a dedicated page, listing all the marked dishes (and their details), while allowing users to remove dishes from the list or send the entire list to an email address of their choice.
