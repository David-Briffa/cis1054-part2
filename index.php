                was established by our founder

                in 1964 and
                has
                been proudly
                serving our customers ever since. Our objective was to always provide our clients with the best
                quality ingredients without compromise, lovingly prepared and transformed by our chefs into the
                dishes you know and love. We specialize in Mediter
                ranean cuisine, and as such, we share strong
                bonds with the local farmers, who provide us only with the freshest local ingredients. As such,
                our
                menu changes in accordance with the seasons.
